Another true to tradition, Neapolitan pizza - Prometeo

Stefano Ferrara ovens are the tell-tale sign of a purist. Prometeo has imported their Ferrara from a small town near Napoli, called Quarto. It only burns wood.

It was a conscious choice to use wood over gas, although gas would have been easier.
